t =int(input('Enter a timestable? ')) # this asks you to enter a value into t
h =int(input('how many times? ')) # this asks you to enter a value into h
for i in range(1,h+1): # This is the range in i, this is how many times it will occur
    print (i, 'x' , t,' =', i*t) # this puts all the values togther allowing it to work out the whole solution
